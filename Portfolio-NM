Certainly, I can provide the contents in paragraph form for your Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for a portfolio website using React.js and Node.js:

1. Introduction: The introduction section of the SRS document outlines the purpose of the document, which is to define the requirements for a portfolio website. It sets the scope of the project, identifies the project's objectives, and includes references to related documents and resources that may be used throughout the development process.

2. System Overview: In this section, we provide an overview of the portfolio website. It describes the high-level architecture, which is based on React.js for the client-side and Node.js for the server-side. We outline the key features and capabilities of the website, along with a discussion of user roles and permissions.

3. Functional Requirements: The functional requirements section delves into the specific features and functionalities that the portfolio website will offer. This includes user registration and authentication, user profile management, portfolio creation and editing, project and work showcase, blog or news section, contact information and communication features, search and filtering functionality, comments and feedback mechanisms, as well as security and permissions. If applicable, it may also address administrative functionality in an admin panel and error handling and logging.

4. Non-Functional Requirements: Non-functional requirements cover aspects beyond functionality. These include performance and scalability considerations, ensuring a positive user experience, security and data protection measures, compatibility with different browsers and devices, ensuring availability and reliability, accessibility for all users, compliance with web standards, and details about the technology stack being used, such as React.js and Node.js. It also considers any third-party integrations and legal or regulatory compliance, such as GDPR.

5. User Stories: This section provides a collection of user stories that capture the specific needs and expectations of different types of users interacting with the portfolio website. These stories help in understanding user requirements and can be used to prioritize features and functionalities.

6. System Architecture: Here, we discuss the architecture of the system in more detail. We explain the client-side architecture built with React.js, covering components and routing, state management (e.g., Redux), APIs and data fetching, and user interface design and styling. On the server-side, using Node.js, we describe the use of RESTful APIs, the choice of database technology (e.g., MongoDB), authentication and authorization mechanisms, file upload and storage, and middleware and routing.

7. Data Models: This section outlines the data models used in the system, including User Model, Profile Model, Portfolio Model, Project Model, Blog Post Model, and Comment Model. These models define the structure of the data used within the application.

8. User Interface: User interface design is an essential aspect of the portfolio website. This section may include wireframes or mockups to illustrate the intended design, as well as design guidelines and principles to follow during development.

9. Security: Security is a critical concern. This section discusses the measures in place for authentication and authorization, data encryption, protection against common web security threats like XSS and CSRF, and access control mechanisms to safeguard user data.

10. Testing: Testing is vital to ensure the quality of the website. This section includes a test plan detailing the approach to testing. It may encompass unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing procedures.

11. Deployment and Hosting: Deploying the website and choosing the hosting environment is addressed in this section. It describes the deployment strategies, hosting environment specifics, and the acquisition of domain names and SSL certificates, if applicable.

12. Maintenance and Support: Maintenance and support are essential post-launch. This section discusses the approach to bug tracking and resolution, as well as any plans for feature updates and general maintenance.

13. Legal and Compliance: This section covers legal aspects, including intellectual property rights, privacy policy, and terms of service. It ensures that the website complies with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

14. Conclusion: In the conclusion, a summary of the SRS is provided, and the document is typically signed off and approved by relevant stakeholders. This marks the completion of the SRS document.

Please note that this is a generic outline, and you should customize it according to your specific project requirements and stakeholders' needs.
